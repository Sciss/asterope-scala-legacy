  *   <li> Deprojecter 2/3:     Transform coordinates in a projection plane to the celestial sphere.
  *   <li> Rotater 3/3:         Rotate coordinates in the celestial sphere
  *   <li> SphereDistorter 3/3: Non-linear transformations in the celestial sphere.
  *   <li> Distorter 2/2:       Non-linear transformations in the projection plane
  *   <li> Scaler 2/2:          Affine transformations in the projection plane
  *   <li> Converter:           Apply a series of conversions in turn.
  * The numbers after the type indicate the dimensionality of the input/output.
