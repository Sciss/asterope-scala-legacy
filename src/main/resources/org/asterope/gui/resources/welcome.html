         Asterope is set of astronomical programs focused on advanced amateur astronomers.
         When finished it will provide skycharting, ephemeris, observation planning,
         telescope control and image manipulation.
         </p><p>
         This program is written in Scala and Java. Asterope is implemented as set of
         astronomical libraries and Swing GUI. It also has command line interface
         and in future Web interface and Android port.
         </p><p>
         Asterope uses libraries developed for professional astronomy. It is inspired by
         virtual observatory and internet cloud services. In return some code developed
         by this project is used in professionals projects, for example Healpix RangeSet
         in Gaia mission or Skyview refactoring for parallel CPU.
